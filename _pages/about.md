I'm a technology leader focused on solving real-world challenges through Software, AI, and Data Science. 

Currently, I lead the development and operations of the [Rapid Analytics Platform](https://rap.bkicloud.com), data engineering, and Data Science/AI initiatives at [Intercontinental Exchange] [https://ice.com], where I focus on building robust data platforms and exploring AI applications in finance and real estate.

My background spans building large-scale data engineering systems, distributed software for supercomputers, and ML acceleration libraries for GPUs. 

In the past, I also served as an adjunct professor, teaching Computer Science courses in AI, ML, Cloud Computing, and Advanced Algorithms.

I earned my Master's in Computer Science from [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T)](https://www.sdsmt.edu/index.html), and MBA from [USC's Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/).

I enjoy collaborating with others and having technical discussions. Please reach out if you want to keep in touch.
