As a technology leader at the intersection of software engineering, AI, and data science, I drive innovation by translating complex technical challenges into scalable business solutions.

I currently spearhead the development and operations of enterprise data analytics and machine learning SaaS products, leading cross-functional teams across software development, data engineering, DevOps/MLOps, and data science. My focus lies in architecting robust software products, building innovative data platforms, and developing cutting-edge GenAI applications, while fostering high-performing teams that consistently deliver exceptional results.

My technical expertise spans multiple domains:

- Architected large-scale data engineering systems for real-time analytics and processing
- Developed distributed software solutions optimized for supercomputing environments
- Created high-performance ML acceleration libraries leveraging GPU capabilities
- Created and productionized data and AI platforms

In the past, I also served as an adjunct professor at universities, teaching computer science courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, and algorithm design, bridging the gap between academic research and industry applications.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) and an MBA from USC's Marshall School of Business, combining deep technical knowledge with strategic business acumen.

I thrive on collaborative innovation and engaging in meaningful technical discussions. Please reach out if you'd like to keep in touch.
